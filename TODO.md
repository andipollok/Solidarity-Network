# TODO LIST & BUG TRACKING

-todo- Datastore: make actions asynchronous, e.g. load activity only when requested

-todo- Photos: photowall instead of activity list

-todo- What's new: hierarchy in importance

-todo- main nav more like tabs than buttons

-todo- agenda: heading "today", "next week"

-todo- calendar: browse months / jump back to today

-todo- activity detail:
        - see what has changed
        - keep me posted button
        - contact host
        - register to attend

-todo- what's new: filter by photos/activities/groups/everything in community

-todo- settings: add icons of communities




# Functionality ideas

- remind host to send email after making a change (pre-composed email?)
