# TODO LIST & BUG TRACKING

-todo- Datastore: make actions asynchronous, e.g. load activity only when requested

-todo- What's new: hierarchy in importance

-todo- Agenda: heading "today", "next week"

-todo- Calendar: browse months / jump back to today

-todo- Activity detail:
        - see what has changed

-todo- What's new: filter by photos/activities/groups/everything in community

-todo- Settings: add icons of communities

-todo- Update to Bootstrap  v4.0.0-alpha.2 http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/ (Problem: it uses SCSS instead of LESS, couldn't get it to run) Advantage would be that it would integrate well with other SCSS style sheets

-todo- Gulpfile: Fix injection of CSS on change - right now it injects and reloads page
